# Face-Detection-based-Illumination
It is a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and intelligent solution designed to make your environment more innovative and more sustainable. Experience the future of lighting control with our innovative system, where illumination is synchronized with human presence for optimal efficiency and convenience.

#Arduino Code Explanation
This code configures an ESP8266-based IoT system to control an LED through a web interface. It establishes a Wi-Fi connection, sets up a web server, and defines routes for turning the LED on and off. The LED's status is tracked, and its state can be changed via HTTP requests or based on an analog sensor's value. The code generates an HTML page with a button to control the LED, synchronizing its state with user input and, potentially, sensor data for automation.

#Python Code Explanation
This Python code utilizes the OpenCV library and HTTP requests to create a real-time face detection system. It captures video frames from the default camera, converts them to grayscale, and employs a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection. When a face is detected, an HTTP GET request is sent to a specified base URL to turn on an external LED; otherwise, it sends a request to turn it off. The code continuously processes frames, displaying the video feed, and it exits when the 'q' key is pressed. It is designed to synchronize lighting with the presence of a detected face in the camera feed and provides status feedback on the success of HTTP requests.
